Few lines about the project

= Introduction =
touchpy is meant to be an python framework to develop media rich
apps with multitouch screens.

= Details =

touchpy is still in early development, but its showing the possibilities
of combining the multitouch screens with compiz/and linux environment.
For now it's developed on linux platform but in the future it should be
pretty easy to port it to other platforms.

Right now the code is still in mess, and the python part will be rewriten
from scrach. As we need events fired on blobIds instead on simple touch events.
That was because one dimensional thinking, as I didn't think of multiple pointers. :)
Anyway the code is still usable, but the problem is that events get fired on every blob
and within the objects receiving that event, there is a need to test if the blob that is producing it is the right one.

Documentation will be written as the projects gets some alpha/beta release.
