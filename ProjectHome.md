Python framework to build media rich applications on top of tuio framework. This gives as possibility to use multitouch screens for input, and It doesn't depends on one implementation only.
One part of the project is also a compiz plugin, which will be used as a debuging output, and a overlay for drawing fast pointers, displaying radial menu etc.
